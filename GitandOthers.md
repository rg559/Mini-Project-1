## Advantages of GIT

- **Performance**

Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better.

- **Security**

Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1.

- **Flexibility**

A key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols.


## Advantages of Git in Organizations

- Git is highly popular and has a widely accepted community. With features such as fork and third party libraries, git is a masterpiece.
- Many developers can collab together and work on the same project creating several branches and showing their distinct work.
- Since Git is a distributed VCS it offers a local repository to each developer with its own history of commits. Hence going back to previous stage is simple.
