## Advantages of GIT

- **Performance**

Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better.

- **Security**

Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1.

- **Flexibility**

A key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols.

- Git is highly popular and has a widely accepted community. With features such as fork and third party libraries, git is a masterpiece.
- Many developers can collab together and work on the same project creating several branches and showing their distinct work.
- Since Git is a distributed VCS it offers a local repository to each developer with its own history of commits. Hence going back to previous stage is simple.

## Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

### Advantages of Docker

- Modernize the traditional applications.
- Docker containers are lightweight by design and ideal for enabling microservices application development.
- It's more secure as even if one container is compromised, the others remain inact.
- Docker makes it easy to maintain different versions of, for example, a website using nginx. You can have a separate container for testing, development, and production on the same Linode and easily deploy to each one.
- With Docker, developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the system on which their code will run. Applications become truly portable. You can repeatably run your application on any other machine running Docker with confidence.
- Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process. A huge benefit of this is the ability to separate non-dependent steps and run them in parallel.


## Automated Testing

Automated testing is the act of conducting specific tests via automation (e.g. a set of regression tests) as opposed to conducting them manually, while test automation refers to automating the process of tracking and managing the different tests. There are many challenges to manual testing such as testing multi-lingual data, time constraint, and execution speed.

### Benefits of Automated Testing

- Significantly **faster** than manual testing (~70% faster)
- Improves **accuracy**, increases **efficiency**, and ensures **consistency**.
- Human Intervention is not required while execution
- Wider test coverage of application features
