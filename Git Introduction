# Welcome to: Introduction to Git

### What you need to know about Git:

**Gitflow Workflow:** a branching method developed by Vincent Driessen; new changes are made in the feature branches which are branched off the Develop Branch. 
The release branch is then created off of the develop branch signaling it is ready for release. 

**Repository:** a folder or project in which all project files and version histories are saved.

**Clone:** downloading a copy of an existing repository project's source code from the source control

**Fork:** copying an exisiting repository (either your own or someone else's)

**Branch:** a parallel version of a repository that does not affect the primary branch so it does not affect the live version.

**Commit:** a change to a file or set of files in a repository that names each Save a unique ID to help identify what changes were made to the file.

**Merge:** merging combines two files from a repository or branch and combines them to create a joint file.

**Checkout:** switches between the current entity you are on with another entity (branch, file, commit, etc)

**Push:** sending your committed changes to a remote repository so that other people can access it.
